'Monkeypox': {
  description:
    'Monkeypox is a viral infection that causes a characteristic rash and flu-like symptoms. The rash typically progresses through stages, starting as flat spots, then raising to bumps, blisters, and finally scabs.\n\nThe infection usually lasts 2-4 weeks and is transmitted through close contact with an infected person, their bodily fluids, or contaminated materials. While usually mild, it can be more severe in immunocompromised individuals, children, and pregnant women.\n\nEarly detection and isolation are crucial to prevent transmission.',
  },
  'Measles': {
    description:
      'Measles is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by a distinctive red rash, fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes. \n\nThe rash typically starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body.\n\nIt can lead to serious complications, particularly in young children and immunocompromised individuals.',
  },
  'Melanoma': {
    description:
      'Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells.\n\nIt often appears as a new or changed mole with irregular borders, varying colors, or asymmetry.\n\nEarly detection and treatment are crucial as melanoma can spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.',
  },
  'Squamous cell carcinoma': {
    description:
      'Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin cancer. It typically appears as a firm, red nodule or a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface.\n\nIt usually occurs on sun-exposed areas of the body and can grow deep into the skin if not treated early.',
  },
  'Vascular lesion': {
    description:
      'Vascular lesions are abnormalities of blood vessels that appear on or under the skin.\n\nThey can present as birthmarks, hemangiomas, or other vascular malformations.\n\nThese lesions can vary in size, color, and appearance, and while many are benign, some may require treatment for medical or cosmetic reasons.',
  },
  'Actinic keratosis': {
    description:
      'Actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly patch on the skin that develops due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays, primarily from the sun.\n\nIt is considered a precancerous condition because it has the potential to progress into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. These patches are often found on sun-exposed areas such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, and hands.\n\nPeople with fair skin and over the age of 40 are more commonly affected. Treatment options include cryotherapy, topical medications, and photodynamic therapy.\n\nEarly detection and regular skin check-ups are crucial for effective management and prevention of complications.'
  },
  'Basal cell carcinoma': {
    description:
      'Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer and is primarily caused by long-term sun exposure or tanning bed use. BCC typically appears as a waxy bump, a sore that doesn not heal, or a flat, flesh-colored scar-like lesion, usually on sun-exposed areas such as the face or neck.\n\nWhile BCC rarely spreads to other parts of the body, it can cause significant damage to surrounding tissues if not treated promptly. Early detection is key, as most cases can be successfully treated through surgical removal, topical medications, or radiation therapy.\n\nPreventive measures include using sunscreen and avoiding UV exposure.'
  },
  'Benign keratosis-like lesion': {
    description:
      'Benign keratosis-like lesions, often referred to as seborrheic keratosis, are common, non-cancerous skin growths that typically appear in older adults.\n\nThese growths can vary in color, ranging from light brown to black, and have a waxy or "stuck-on" appearance. Although they are harmless and do not require treatment, they can sometimes become irritated or cosmetically undesirable. In such cases, removal methods like cryotherapy or laser therapy can be used.\n\nIt\'s important to monitor any skin growths and consult a dermatologist if there are any concerns or changes.'
  },
  'Chickenpox': {
    description:
      'Chickenpox is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It primarily affects children and presents as an itchy rash with fluid-filled blisters, often accompanied by fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite.\n\nThe rash usually starts on the face and torso before spreading to other parts of the body. While chickenpox is generally mild in children, it can lead to serious complications in adults, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems.\n\nVaccination is the most effective way to prevent chickenpox. Symptomatic treatments such as calamine lotion, antihistamines, and fever-reducing medications can help manage discomfort.'
  },
  'Cowpox': {
    description:
      'Cowpox is a rare viral infection caused by the cowpox virus, which belongs to the orthopoxvirus family. It is usually transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals, such as cows, cats, or rodents.\n\nThe disease typically manifests as red, inflamed blisters or pustules on the skin, often at the site of contact. While cowpox is usually self-limiting and resolves on its own within a few weeks, it can be more severe in individuals with compromised immune systems.\n\nProper hygiene and avoiding contact with potentially infected animals are key preventive measures.'
  },
  'Dermatofibroma': {
    description:
      'Dermatofibroma is a common, benign skin growth that often appears as a firm, raised bump on the skin. These growths are usually brown, red, or pink and are most commonly found on the legs.\n\nWhile the exact cause is unknown, they may develop as a reaction to minor skin injuries such as insect bites or ingrown hairs.\n\nDermatofibromas are harmless and typically do not require treatment unless they cause discomfort or cosmetic concerns. If removal is desired, options include surgical excision or cryotherapy.'
  },
  'HFMD': {
    description:
      'Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious viral illness most commonly seen in children under five years of age. It is caused by enteroviruses, such as the coxsackievirus.\n\nSymptoms include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The disease usually resolves on its own within 7-10 days, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms, such as pain and dehydration.\n\nPracticing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing and disinfecting surfaces, is essential in preventing the spread of HFMD.'

  'Healthy': {
    description:
      'Your skin is healthy and free from visible diseases or abnormalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
  },
  'Melanocytic nevus': {
    description:
      'A melanocytic nevus, commonly known as a mole, is a benign growth on the skin that develops from melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment. These moles can vary in size, shape, and color, often appearing during childhood or adolescence.\n\nWhile most melanocytic nevi are harmless, some can develop into melanoma, a type of skin cancer.\n\nIt is important to monitor moles for changes in size, shape, or color, as well as any new symptoms such as itching or bleeding. If any abnormalities are observed, a dermatologist should be consulted for further evaluation.'
